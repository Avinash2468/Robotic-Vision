# How to run our code


### Task 1
* Go to ./code/Assignment_2.1/2_1.ipynb. Run this jupyter notebook sequentially.  

### Task 2
* Go to ./code/Assignment_2.2/2_2.ipynb. Run this jupyter notebook sequentially.  
* To change the value of threshold change the values threshold1 (for individual bin) and threshold2 (for multiple scans).  

After running the code it will generate the results, follow the below instructions to access those.  

# How to access genetated results

### Task 1
* Go to ./Data/Results/2_1. There should be a pcd names final_pcd.

### Task 2, 1st Question
* Go to ./Data/Results/2_2/1st.
* There is a video named bin0-76.mp4. That video shows how all our occupancy grids look when played sequentially.
* In the photos folder, the individual occupancy grids for each bin are stored.

### Task 2, 2nd Question
* Go to ./Data/Results/2_2/2nd.
* You can find the occupancy grid after concatenating 5,10,15 occupancy grids respectively.  

### Google drive link
Please find complete results here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F5-oQmo9FeCWK2YaXm8s9NZOo5PUVMBb?usp=sharing  
* The results obtained are in the folder "Results" in the google drive link
* Results folder contains 2 folders 2_1 and 2_2
* Results/2_1 contains .pcd and .png file of the obtained pcd
* Results/2_2/1st/photos → individual outputs
* Results/2_2/1st/ → contains a timelapse video of all photos in photos folder
* Results/2_2/2nd/ → outputs of multiple scans
