# Assignment-3

This assignment is intended to get you familiar with non-linear least squares optimization and iterative closest point algorithm.

The ipython notebook (`.ipynb`) is self-sufficient and has all the information you need to get started with the assignment, you don't need any corresponding PDF doc. Just fire up the notebook and get going!

Environment Setup: Just activate Assignment-1's environment and install matplotlib using `python -m pip install -U matplotlib`. You're good to go!

A PDF doc has still been uploaded but it serves no other purpose than quick reference.

## Submission
On Moodle, all you have to submit is the jupyter notebook. But make sure to call the necessary functions explicitly (as specified in the notebook).

There will be no deadline extensions. Go through the late policy in the official "Course Information" document.
